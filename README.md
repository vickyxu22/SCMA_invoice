# SCMA_invoice
This repository contains a script for extracting publication text from Smith College Museum of Art invoice documents in DOCX format. The script parses the documents to retrieve attributions such as author, title, format, publication date, etc. The extracted information is then merged into an Excel file for convenient usage and integration into the Mimsy database.
